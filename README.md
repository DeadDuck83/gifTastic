# gifTastic
Gif generator powered by Giphy API

  -  This app takes a preset array of strings. Those strings will be turned into buttons.

  -  Each button will call from the Giphy API to request Gifs based on the value of each button.

  -  You also have the ability to add new buttons that will request the new value from the Giphy API.

  -  In order to keep things PC, a Gif rating is placed at the bottom of each Gif, as well as using the still image on first load. By clicking the Gif, the animation will begin.
